        <div class="item-card">
            <p class="home">Nowadays every educational institution in the society is digitalised. So this creates a need for developing a college management system for our GECI which is effective, time consuming and has a large database of all the pupils working or studying there.</p>
            <p class="home">The CMS deals with all kinds of student details, staff details, college details, academic related details, course details, announcements, request related procedures and other resource related details too.</p>
            <p class="home"> It tracks all the details and records of a student from the first day to the last day of his academic life and it will be available for the future references too. This can facilitate us explore all the activities happening in the college up-to-date. Students and Teachers are connected together and can pass information via their accounts. Different views and records are generated for different users .</p>
            <p class="home"> This is an essential system for every college and we have worked hard in developing this system. But this is limited to only people in our college.</p>
